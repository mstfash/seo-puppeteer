A project that renders javascript based applications on each request on the server so it gives a better SEO compatibility for the search engines. pretty useful for React, Vue, Angular etc.

Best that this is deployed by docker as a container

This is deployed as a server based, so basically its `${SERVER_URL}/render?url=${botUrl}` and it gives you a fully rendered text of the page.

When deployed to a server, watch out of the memory usage!
